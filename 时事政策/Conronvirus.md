Anyone remember the "sealing off 11 million people" in China?

"When Wuhan’s lockdown was first announced Jan. 23, the world was aghast: sealing off 11 million people—a population larger than New York City—had never been attempted in human history. On March 24, after no new local infections were recorded for several days running, officials announced plans to end the measure."

The UK has x6 the population of Wuhan. Deaths here are not yet x6 greater than in Wuhan. But when deaths here do exceed that x6, we should have a bit more humility imo. The strategy here initially was to let the virus run its course - to encourage, so called, "herd immunity". Soon we'll know which strategy would have been better.

The number difference may be due to how each country implemented the lock down. When Wuhan was locked down, it wasn’t merely a “recommendation” people stay home, it was imposed and people actually followed the government order, everything was shut and nobody went outside.

The UK lockdown is a joke. I went for a walk outside in London today around the local residential streets and the HIgh street, still saw many people out and about, the small local park had probably 30 people likely because the sun was out today. Queues outside M&S and sainsbury, many cars on the roads. Maybe 10% of people wore masks. People in uk just don’t take this seriously and the daily ~800 deaths reflects our behaviour.

in Wuhan they shut down all the public transportation, even doctors were forced to bike miles to work before citizens started helping out. idk how it is in the uk but in NYC the subway is still running, and it's pretty much impossible to social distance on the subway.
