China doesn’t want Trump to lose! On Chinese and Russian eyes, who other than Trump can make a better US president.

It was proven that Putin helped Trump get into the White House. I’m NOT Saying that trump was aware or encouraged Putin’s moves but there is evidence that he did try to help trump get in.

But why would Putin want Trump to become president? He did it because he hates the US with a passion, he’s ex-KGB, he was indoctrinated into hating the US, he wants the US to fail and die. And with good reason considering the US screwed Russia during the 90s and made it far worse than it was pre USSR collapse. He wants Trump in the WH because there was no one standing to become President more useless and stupid than Trump and a man who would cause serious harm to America and its people.

Now we’re coming up to the next election and I’m sure Putin will do it all again but better this time because lessons have been learned.

There is also China and Xi. What do you think they are going to do? Just sit there and watch? Nope! China and Xi will join with Putin - they are allies these days - to try their best to convince enough Americans to vote for Trump so he can total trash the US for another 4 years.

In fact I can imagine Xi and Putin trying to make Trump President for Life! That would really finish off the US!
