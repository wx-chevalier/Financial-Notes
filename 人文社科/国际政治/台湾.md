# 台湾的政治

Democracy in Taiwan is a joke.

Plenty of resources and time are spent on elections, but only corrupt officials are elected to office. Take a look at Chen Shuibian.

Freedom of speech is abused. The politicians, the journalists and reporters are talking nonsense every day. Many many ridiculous comments about mainland China.

The judicial system is misused too. It is used as a tool to fight against the political rivalries.

The elected officials are short-sighted. They fight for the benefits of their own or their party rather than the overall benefits of the people on the island.

In a self-claimed democratic island, they just do not respect the democratic processes. If you do not believe this, just take a look at the evolution of referendum there.

Democracy serves to divide the society rather than unite the society. The short-sighted politicians manipulate the sentiments of the people and incite hatred among them.

Maybe you think I am a Wumao. But to tell you the truth, when Chen Shuibian was elected in 2000, many Chinese people, including me, had fancy about the democracy in Taiwan and hoped that mainland China may also switch to the democratic system in Taiwan. But nearly 20 years later, when taking a look at at what has happened to Taiwan, I think that democracy in Taiwan is a total disaster.

The democracy in Taiwan will continue to prove its failure!
